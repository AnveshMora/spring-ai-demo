# AI Demo: Using Spring boot ai

## Prerequisites
- Java 21
- Maven

---
This project requires an OpenAI API key to be defined and provided to the application via Spring-accessible environment variables.
For more information on ways to supply this value to your application, please refer to https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/features/external-config.html[the Spring Boot docs reference on Externalized Configuration].
If you use an alternative provider, please refer to the https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/[Spring AI documentation for the variables applicable to your choice of models/implementations].

TL;DR: You'll need *at a minimum* to have a variable `SPRING_AI_OPENAI_API_KEY` with your OpenAI-assigned API key in your application environment if you're using OpenAI's API.
